          <h1>Our Conservation Process</h1>
          <p>
            Teddy Duffy Conservation in conjunction with our partners, Horizon Group, have been providing conservation and heritage 
            surveys for a number of years. During that time, we have grown to appreciate the high level of detail required on such 
            prestigious redevelopment projects. We use top-of-the-range 3D laser scanners, traditional survey instruments, 
            HD cameras, and other high-accuracy solutions to collect the required data. 
            Our scanners collect millimetre-precision data at extremely tight intervals, ensuring we always capture enough 
            information to model even the most intricate architectural details. This data is then processed by our in-house 
            production teams to deliver high-accuracy BIM models, scaled drawings, and many more deliverables tailored to your needs.

           <h2>Building Conservation</h2>
          <p>
            Building conservation involves the careful management of change to a heritage asset, focusing on maintaining, 
            protecting, and reinforcing its heritage value. It's a process that aims to prolong the material, historical, 
            and design integrity of a building. This involves minimizing interventions, respecting the building's aesthetics and 
            significance, and preventing destruction or alteration of historical evidence.
          </p>
           <h2>Green Building</h2>
            <p>Incorporating lime into construction isn’t just a nod to tradition—it’s a step forward in green building. 
               From reducing carbon emissions to enabling healthier, more breathable structures, lime is one of the most 
               environmentally responsible choices in modern construction.Looking for sustainable conservation solutions? 
               Choose lime, good for your building, and even better for the planet.</p>

          <h3>Why Using Lime in Construction is Better for the Environment</h3>
          <p>When it comes to sustainable building practices, lime stands out as an eco-friendly alternative to modern cement. 
            As the world moves toward greener solutions in construction, lime-based materials are gaining renewed recognition. 
            Here’s why using lime in building projects is not just smart—but sustainable.</p>
            <ul class="modern-list">
               <li><h5>Lime Absorbs Carbon Dioxide</h5>
               <p>Unlike traditional Portland cement, lime products undergo a process called carbonation, 
                  where they absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere as they cure. Over time, lime reverts back to calcium 
                  carbonate—the material it originally came from—making it a carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative 
                  choice when sourced and applied responsibly.</p></li>
                  <li><h5>Lower Energy Production</h5>
                  <p>Lime is produced at lower kiln temperatures (around 900°C) compared to cement, which requires up to 1450°C. 
                     This results in significantly lower CO₂ emissions during manufacturing.</p></li>
               <li><h5>Natural, Non-Toxic Material</h5>
               <p>Made from limestone and other naturally occurring minerals, lime is free of synthetic chemicals. 
                  It is safe for both construction workers and building occupants, promoting healthier indoor environments.
               </p></li>
               <li><h5>Breathable & Moisture-Regulating</h5>
               <p>Lime mortars and plasters are highly breathable, allowing moisture to evaporate rather than getting trapped 
                  inside walls. This prevents mould growth, structural decay, and improves indoor air quality.
               </p></li>
               <li><h5>Long-Lasting & Recyclable</h5>
               <p>Lime-built structures are not only durable but also easy to maintain. 
                  Lime mortars can be repointed or reworked without demolition, and old lime materials can be recycled or 
                  reabsorbed into the environment safely.
               </p></li>
            <li><h5>Ideal for Heritage Buildings</h5>
            <p>Lime is the traditional building material used in historic structures. 
               It offers the flexibility, porosity, and visual character required for authentic restoration—supporting cultural 
               preservation and reducing the environmental cost of replacement.
